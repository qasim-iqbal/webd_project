# webd_project
Final project for the web development class, the idea is to make blog website for students

The website is made using NodeJs for backend and EJS for templating. 
The site has login functionality, and allows user to Create, Read, Update and Delete blogs. Users can also reply to existing blog posts.

The database part is done using MongoDb and schema is added to the models directory.

The website also makes use of D3 and webservices to show statistics for articles uploaded.

Most of the styling for the site was done using Bootstarp.
